# Normalization and Data Models for ICC teams of World Cup 2019 Database


ABSTRACT
ICC Worldcup 2019 has been decided as our domain consisting of the following data sets

ICC_CWC_19_teams

ICC_CWC_19_players

ICC_CWC_19_boards

ICC_CWC_19_Teams being a large data set was normalised into different data sets so as to have the database in 1NF,2NF,3NF.

Primary focus was to normalize dataset used in the previous assignment, cleaning of data, checking null values present in the data, data munging and to reformat the data to fit a conceptual database model.
